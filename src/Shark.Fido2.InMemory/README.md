Shark FIDO2 authentication library for .NET provides a server-side implementation of the FIDO2 protocol, enabling secure passwordless and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for web applications. It supports key FIDO2 operations - credential registration and authentication - ensuring compliance with the WebAuthn Level 2 specification (Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials Level 2).

This package provides an in-memory implementation for storing FIDO2 credentials, allowing for quick setup and testing without requiring an external database.
